Coding Question: Design a Security Deposit Box Class Difficulty: Easy–Medium (OOP / classes) Problem Design a class to represent a security deposit box in a bank vault. Each security deposit box has: A unique box ID (e.g., an integer or string). Dimensions: length, width, height (in centimeters). A record of items stored inside the box. The box should be able to tell: How much volume is already taken by items. How much volume is still available. Whether a new item can fit based on its volume. We will assume each item has: A name (string) A volume in cubic centimeters (integer or float) Requirements Implement a class SecurityDepositBox with at least the following: 1. Constructor def __init__(self, box_id: str, length_cm: float, width_cm: float, height_cm: float): ... Initializes: The unique box_id The box dimensions An empty collection of stored items. 2. Method: add_item def add_item(self, name: str, volume_cm3: float) -> bool: ... Tries to add an item with the given name and volume_cm3 to the box. Only adds the item if there is enough remaining volume. Returns: True if the item was added successfully. False if there is not enough space and the item is not added. 3. Method: remove_item def remove_item(self, name: str) -> bool: ... Removes the first item matching the given name (if any). Returns: True if an item with that name was found and removed. False otherwise. 4. Method: get_used_volume def get_used_volume(self) -> float: ... Returns the total volume currently used by all items in the box. 5. Method: get_available_volume def get_available_volume(self) -> float: ... Returns how much volume is still available in the box. 6. Method: list_items def list_items(self) -> list: ... Returns a list of the items currently stored in the box. (You can decide the structure, e.g., list of dicts or list of (name, volume) tuples.) Derived Values The total capacity of the box is: capacity = 𝑙 𝑒 𝑛 𝑔 𝑡 ℎ _ 𝑐 𝑚 × 𝑤 𝑖 𝑑 𝑡 ℎ _ 𝑐 𝑚 × ℎ 𝑒 𝑖 𝑔 ℎ 𝑡 _ 𝑐 𝑚 capacity=length_cm×width_cm×height_cm You should use this capacity to decide if a new item fits. Example Usage You don’t need to code this part explicitly as output, but your class should support something like: box = SecurityDepositBox("A-101", 10, 10, 10) # capacity = 1000 cm^3 box.add_item("Passport", 50) # True box.add_item("Jewelry box", 400) # True box.get_used_volume() # 450 box.get_available_volume() # 550 box.add_item("Large document folder", 700) # False, not enough space box.remove_item("Passport") # True box.list_items() # should show remaining items 👉 Your Turn Go ahead and implement this in Python: Define the SecurityDepositBox class. Implement all the methods as described. Keep it simple and readable (no fancy Python features required). When you’re done, paste your code here, and I’ll: Review it, Suggest improvements (both style and interview-readiness), And then, if you want, show you my version and discuss tradeoffs.
