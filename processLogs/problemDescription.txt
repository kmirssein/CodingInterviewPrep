Problem Description

You are given a list of log entries representing user activity in a system.
Each log entry is a string in the following format:

"<user_id> <timestamp> <action>"


Where:

<user_id> is a string representing the user (e.g., "30")

<timestamp> is a non-negative integer

<action> is either "sign-in" or "sign-out"

A user session begins at a sign-in entry and ends at the next corresponding sign-out entry for the same user.

Your task is to determine which users had short sessions, defined as:

session duration = (sign-out time) – (sign-in time)


A session is considered valid if the duration is less than or equal to maximumTime.

Logs may appear out of chronological order, so you must sort them by timestamp before processing.

🔵 Function Signature
def processEvents(logs: list[str], maximumTime: int) -> list[str]:
    pass


logs: list of event strings

maximumTime: integer threshold

return: list of user IDs (strings) whose sessions are ≤ maximumTime, sorted numerically

🔵 Example 1
Input
logs = [
    "30 12 sign-in",
    "30 25 sign-out",
    "100 4 sign-in",
    "20 15 sign-in",
    "100 20 sign-out",
    "20 35 sign-out"
]
maximumTime = 20

Output
["20", "30", "100"]

Explanation

Sorted by timestamp, the events become:

time	user	action
4	100	sign-in
12	30	sign-in
15	20	sign-in
20	100	sign-out
25	30	sign-out
35	20	sign-out

Sessions:

User 100: 20 − 4 = 16 ≤ 20 → valid

User 30: 25 − 12 = 13 ≤ 20 → valid

User 20: 35 − 15 = 20 ≤ 20 → valid

Return users sorted: ["20", "30", "100"]
